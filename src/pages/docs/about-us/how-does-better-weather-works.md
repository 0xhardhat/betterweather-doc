## 1. Creating Markets

We create engaging prediction markets using reliable weather APIs like OpenWeather and NOAA.

## 2. Setting Odds and Trading Shares

Market odds are generated by the users' decisions. Shares are created when opposing participants agree on the odds, with each pair fully collateralized in USDC.

## 3. Resolving Markets and Payouts

Markets are resolved using data from credible sources like NWS. Winning shares are paid $1.00 USDC each.
